# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal worklog repository containing a single markdown file (`worklog.md`) that tracks work completed by Neekon Saadat for Inquis Medical Inc. The worklog documents code review and documentation efforts on a medical software project.

## File Structure

- `worklog.md` - Time-based work documentation with daily entries, including morning/afternoon sessions and detailed task descriptions

## Working with this Repository

This repository contains only documentation files and does not include source code, build scripts, or development dependencies. All work involves editing the worklog markdown file to add new entries, update existing content, or reorganize the documentation structure.

When updating the worklog:
- Follow the established format with week headers, daily entries, and time-based sections
- Maintain the consistent structure: date, hours worked, morning/afternoon breakdown
- Include specific technical details about work completed
- Use proper markdown formatting for code references and lists
