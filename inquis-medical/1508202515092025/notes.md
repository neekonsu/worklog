## August 18-22 2025:
*This week was spent dicsussing Doxygen-generated diagrams for Mark S. and reviewing Paul N.'s CentraCare case.*
*I spent time programming a python cli for fast-annotating ipad logs, with the aim being to abstract the legend for event tags we use from the user who's annotating and from the UI that annotates.*
*The desired outcome was accelerating annoation entries using (sub)menus, making the annotation pipeline maintainable as the tags themselves evolve, and illuminating any deficits in the current legend.*

### August 18-20:
- monday [8.0]: met with mark to discuss doxygen
- - after initial disapproval of doxygen integration, I enabled include / call / caller graph generation and Mark approved this functionality
- - Reviewed centracare case with team (Paul's presentation on data and event classifications)
- tuesday [8.0]: produced program to interactively enter events using key file to both accelerate annotations and create an input that's agnostic to the legend (as opposed to the excel dropdowns which are poor UI and not easily updated.
- - Met with team to discuss findings and learned that we had misinterpreted the Gen3 Pipeline review tasks. Mark brought his presentation back on the screen and Rose and I reoriented ourselves towards those tasks.
- wednesday [7.0]:
- - Spent the day reviewing code for Zach and Discussing the classifier with Rose
- - Attended systems group check in meeting and discussed pipeline with team
- thursday [8.0]:
- - Remote, did not work in office
- - Time spent producing invoice for 14 July - 15 August
- friday [8.0]:
- - Morning code review to finalize feedback for Zach
- - Spent 30min brainstorming / syncing with Rose on the classifier/pipeline evaluation process and delegating that task to focus on finishing meaningful suggestions for Zach.
