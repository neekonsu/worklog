### Bruno olshausen's group meeting (first time attending)
- bruno: we should think about renaming "resonator entwokrs" because it isn't given that "bouncing around" before "snapping/converging" is optimal behavior, it is what researchers saw and they named it byh how it looked.
- resonators: theta (main state); hadamard product of a handful of unit vectors in any direction in HD space. "Degeneracy === redundancy"
- theta can be formulated with elementwise product or conv; not speciifcally hadamard
- resonator algo: estimate u hat, v hat, w hat (synch or async update) until they converge on specific u v w (actual) given theta.
- each estimator u v w hat depends on theta, and the two other variables.
- kroenecker multiple vecotrs: like outer product matrix unraveled/flattened to vector
- bruno argued w chris on his wording "quash linearity" instead of "squash"
