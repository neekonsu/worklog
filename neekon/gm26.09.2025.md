# notes
- Where should be doped (such as comb drive)
- dopants have strong influence on mechanical stress (comb should be doped, but may cause undesireable bends and stress)
- be familiar with how to translate structure to layout
- we need to start with modeling mechanics; comsol -> lumerical -> layout -> DRC
- We need to be novel, even though we still want to begin with the reference
- Glyfason has super long suspended waveguides, free floating, not precise
- Sunyeun's paper:

- gatekeeping features; 1. needs good optical performance 2, where you place the anchor so it doesn't cause optical loss 3. controlling gaps for producing reliable anchor
- small design, go through whole process, make sure we can turn design into layout into drc as ASAP


- metrics
- optical loss, driving voltage, transmission vs {transmission voltage (can go higher than 10V), frequency, gap, driving waveform (tune driving waveform i.e. LUT based PID controll to anticipate nonlinearity across acruation length)}, spring constant in desireable and perpendicular acutation direction, torsional strength, phenomenological model for stiction (proportional to contact area, inversely proportional to the gap)
